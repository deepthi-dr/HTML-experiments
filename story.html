                to prepare for cultivation, and we get many seasonal fruits and vegetables.The summer season brings so much happiness to everyone. 
                Everyone eagerly waits for summer to come. People get a chance to enjoy the sun and its heat. People can go outside to enjoy the sun. 
                People spend most of their day outside during summer. They want to feel hot sun rays on their face and body, which makes them feel 
                refreshed. The summer season is too good for students as they can enjoy long vacations in summer. They do not have to go to school 
                and can enjoy their vacations. They can take part in different activities that they like to do. Kids love the summer season as it 
                is the time for playing outside. They can go to a swimming pool, park or any other place where they can enjoy playing.

            There are 
                so many things for children to do during summer. They can also go on a trip with their family and friends. People can also enjoy t
                heir time by sitting outside their homes. And castles make for a perfect summer day at the beach. When going to the pool, one will 
                most likely find a suntan lotion dispenser. From late afternoon thunderstorms to s'mores by the campfire with friends and family, 
                summers are a wonderful time of year filled with many different stereotypical memories that pop into mind as the word is spoken.
                The summer season, which is full of heat and dust, is a blessing in disguise. The scorching rays of the sun evaporate the water from 
                all water bodies at this time, aBesides the innumerable difficulties people face, it is the most awaited season, especially by the 
                students. They get over with their final exams, and it is vacation time for them as well as their parents. They plan to visit their 
                grandparents or places like hill stations to escape the heat. Some also go to the beaches, as they are very pleasant at night. 
                Children take up many indoor activities. Swimming and other water sports are some favorite outdoor activities in this season, making 
                it somewhat pleasant. Summer break for the students is a good time for learning various new activities. Most students go for summer 
                camps at cooler places.nd this phenomenon gives way to the advent of the rainy season. The low pressure created over the 
                landmass of India during this season is responsible for months-long monsoon rain. Summer fruits are mango,grapes,oranges etc
